As a security engineer, these are suggestions for security measures we may put in place on our servers to protect 
them from brute force attacks and stop unauthorized access. We must obtain management approval before implementing 
these modifications. These adjustments are as follows:

1. Implement two-factor authentication
2. Use TCP wrappers to limit access to specific hosts
3. Implement brute-force protection such as Fail2ban
